This script allows us to import a CSV of Webinar registration/attendee data into Common Room.

The script relies on a single environment variable (a token generated by Common Room) for authentication

`COMMONROOM_TOKEN` 

The script accepts three arguments:

- Destination ID
- CSV file path
- Webinar Name

```
